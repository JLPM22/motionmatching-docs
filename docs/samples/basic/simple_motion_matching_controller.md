# Simple Motion Matching Controller Sample

!!! info
	To access this sample, first open the Package Manager, select **Motion Matching**, and then import the examples by navigating to **Samples > Examples** and clicking **Import**.

The sample can be located at `Examples/Scenes/00_Basic/ExampleSimpleMMController.unity`. This sample showcases how to use a `SimpleMMController` to drive a character using Motion Matching with a custom script. You will find in the scene's hierarchy two GameObjects that can be enabled and disabled to control whether the character's trajectory is computed randomly or using the Keyboard ASWD keys. Take a look at these scripts and the `SimpleMMController` to understand how to use Motion Matching in your project.

!!! note
	See [SimpleMMController](../../basics/using_simple_motion_matching_controller.md) for more information on how to use the `SimpleMMController`.
