# Roadmap

Here's a list of upcoming features and improvements to enhance the capabilities and usability of the Motion Matching package for Unity:

## Planned Features

- [ ] **Enhanced Documentation**: Work on a more comprehensive guide explaining the intricacies of Motion Matching. For now, you can refer to the author's [master thesis](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/363377742_Motion_Matching_for_Character_Animation_and_Virtual_Reality_Avatars_in_Unity).

- [ ] **Pose Feature Customization**: Expand the types of pose features available.

- [ ] **Motion Capture Library**: Record additional motion capture data and create default avatars for immediate use in projects.

- [ ] **Visual Debugging Tools**: Develop a suite of visual debugging tools for easier inspection and adjustment during development. Additionally, visualization of databases.

- [ ] **Memory Optimization with Deep Learning**: Investigate the use of deep learning algorithms to reduce memory usage in the system.

- [ ] **Unity 6 DOTS version**: Create a version of the package that utilizes Unity's Data-Oriented Technology Stack (DOTS) for improved performance.

- [ ] **Inverse Kinematics Integration**: Integrate inverse kinematics (IK) for more realistic character interactions.

- [ ] **Event System**: Implement an event system for triggering actions based on specific conditions in the animation.

- [ ] **Networked Motion Matching**: Develop a networked version of Motion Matching for multiplayer games.

## Completed Features

- [x] **BVH Editor with Tagging**: Introduced a BVH editor that supports real-time complex tag queries.
  
- [x] **Unity Animation System Integration**: Added tools and methods for seamless integration with Unity's native animation system. This allows, for example, the use of Unity's animation system for the upper body while utilizing Motion Matching for the lower body.

- [x] **Unity Package Structure**: Successfully restructured the project into a Unity package for easier distribution and integration.

- [x] **Trajectory Customization**: Implement a more user-friendly system for modifying trajectory features.

- [x] **PathCharacterController Upgrades**: Revise the current hardcoded path tools in favor of a more flexible system, possibly using splines or other advanced techniques.

Your contributions and suggestions are always welcome as we continue to develop this project into a comprehensive Motion Matching solution for Unity.
